This is my personal website. I am a data engineer specializing in Web3 and have worked on various projects related to on-chain security and data. I am excited about blockchain, Rust, game development, open source, and combining crazy ideas. I hope you enjoy reading my posts. If you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to contact me.
